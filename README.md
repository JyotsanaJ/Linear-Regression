# regression
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to Linear Regression, including implementing it from scratch, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and applying Feature Engineering techniques. Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous target variables based on one or more input features.

## Contents
1.  **Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch**
    
    *   This notebook demonstrates how to implement Linear Regression from scratch using basic Python libraries such as NumPy. It covers the mathematical foundations of linear regression, including calculating the coefficients (slope and intercept) using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.
    *   Notebook: `linear_Regression_From_Scratch.ipynb`
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    
    *   EDA is a crucial step in understanding the data before building any predictive models. This notebook explores various techniques for visualizing and analyzing the dataset to gain insights into relationships between variables and identify potential patterns.
    
3.  **Feature Engineering**
    
    *   Feature Engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of predictive models. This notebook covers techniques such as handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and creating interaction terms.
    
4. **Implement Linear regression also using scikit learn libraries**
    * We also implement Linear regression also using scikit learn libraries, So that we can compare results from our model and the scikit learn model that is fit and transformed on the same dataset.
